    <b>An intro to SQL</b>
  </p>
</h3>

A European travel guide was created in an SQL database management class as the final project.
The goal was to apply our understanding of SQL to a hands-on project with a real-world application and UI. Our UI is the terminal, cut short on time to make it anything special.

The following is our guide:

- A user begins by running our file, a Python-based script:
```$python3 tourist_guide.py```

- A welcome/ login message is then displayed:

<br/><br/>


- From here, you can either log in with an existing account or create one.
  - Logging in leads to a better explanation of what the guide does.

Each command is error-handled!

- The following demonstrates different command uses:
